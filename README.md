# Pandas-Cheat-Sheet
Pandas is a powerful open source data analysis library for Python. It is used for a wide range of data manipulation tasks, including data munging, data cleaning, data wrangling, and data visualisation. This cheat sheet provides a quick reference to some of the most common Pandas functions and commands.

## Data Structures

Pandas has two primary data structures - Series and DataFrames.


## Series

A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object containing a sequence of values and an associated array of data labels, called its index.


## DataFrames

A DataFrame is a two-dimensional array-like object, with labeled rows and columns. It can be thought of as a collection of Series objects, each with the same index.
